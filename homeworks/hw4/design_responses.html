					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article I learned about the issue of color accessibility, which I had previously never thought about. I learned about how people with visual impairment may not experience colors the same way. Thus it is importat for designers to take this into account by using different contrasts and using labels to help those with impairments have a better user experience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favority part of the article was when they gave us tools that could help us as designer be more color accessable. They suggested tools like Colorsafe and Colorable. I thought that this was particularly helpful because these are tools I wouldn't have thought to use before.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web we're all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people." </p>
						</li>
