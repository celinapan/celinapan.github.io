					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned how even something as simple as fonts can be so crucial to how an audience perceives a design. For example, some fonts are more approriate for younger age groups while more senior age group might find other fonts more approriate. Furthermore, the way you pair fonts and size them in relative to eachother matters for your audience.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is that way it describes typography as both a science and an art. The idea of constant experimentation in design seems very fun and gives a lot of room for exploration. Even throughout the whole article, every suggestion the author gives leads back to some form of experimentation and exploration on the designers end. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  "Text is one of the primary ways designers can communicate with users. Typography can make or break a design." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
