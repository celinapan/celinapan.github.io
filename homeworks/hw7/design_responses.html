						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that our brains work in a very cool way. I learned that our brains fill in gaps and we can use that within our designs. I learned that using these principles we can group things in our design to highlight similarities and differences within a website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the visuals provided by the article. Seeing the side by side layouts and differences in groupings was really helpful. Its difficult to imagine the principles so having a visual example following the description was a good teaching tactic. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts. Its correct use will have a positive impact on visual communication and user experience." </p>
						</li>
