                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article I learned how important movement and interaction are within design. Different movements can help users understand where they are in their user flow and make processes more intuitive. It was cool to see how designers can be intentional in how they used movement to persuade and help the users. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was that there wasn't any reading rather it was mainly GIFs. This was really cool to me because even though there was no words, I still learned alog about interactive designing. I thoguht it was really cool to see the movement and have the mockups there.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite was the inspiration with the ETH wallet. I thought it was really interesting to incorporate movement during the waiting time of a payment transfer. I think that this acheived the design goals well. It let the user know that something was happening behind the scenes through the movement on the screen. It was also done so in a way that was intuitive for the user and nice to look at. </p>

                            <p> 8/10! I learned a lot about interactive design through a really visual manner. </p>
