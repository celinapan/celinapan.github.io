					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned how design can be used to manipulate users. Even in the past before the web was super popular dark patterns were used to get users to do certain things. Now its even more important to be careful because it seems that almost all brands implement dark pattern strategies. </p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
