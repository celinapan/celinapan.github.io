					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article I learned how differences in animation can impact user experience. For example, the optimal speed of animation usually lies between 200ms and 500ms. I also learned that the size of the the device impacts how you should animate things. For example, transitions should be shorter on mobile devices that other larger devices. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article were the animation included with the text. It was nice to see a direct example of what the text was describing. Being able to have examples of what is considered good and what is considered bad was easier to tell when the animation showed it directly.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  "Whenever you doubt what type of motion to use in your animation, use standard curve." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
